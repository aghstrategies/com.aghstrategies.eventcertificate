Page created by extension:

http://wpmaster/wp-admin/admin.php?page=CiviCRM&q=civicrm%2Feventcertificate&cid=203&eid=2

Things to do:

1. create a button on the page to download the template as a pdf (https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/blob/c1cc5247b974a534b24fb4e9315d82e276fecea6/CRM/Contact/Form/Task/PDFLetterCommon.php#L402) or just make it happen automatically by uncommenting code in run?
2. Make html to convert to pdf that looks like NASWs
3. on uninstall remove message template created by the extension
4. make event/participant tokens work
5. settings page to put text to display if person goes to visit the page that does not have a certificate, role type and participant status
