Page created by extension:

http://wpmaster/wp-admin/admin.php?page=CiviCRM&q=civicrm%2Feventcertificate&cid=203&eid=2

Things to do:

1. create a button on the page to download the template as a pdf (https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/blob/c1cc5247b974a534b24fb4e9315d82e276fecea6/CRM/Contact/Form/Task/PDFLetterCommon.php#L402) or just make it happen automatically by uncommenting code in run?
3. on uninstall remove message template created by the extension
4. write logic for when you are logged in
5. settings page to put text to display if person goes to visit the page that does not have a certificate
